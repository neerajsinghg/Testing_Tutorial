# 30.Write a Python program to find the length of a tuple.
# Create a tuple by converting the string "w3resource" into a tuple
tuplex = tuple("w3resource")
# Print the contents of the 'tuplex' tuple
print(tuplex)

# Use the 'len()' function to determine the length of the 'tuplex' tuple
print(len(tuplex)) 
# O/p: (‘w’, ‘3’, ‘r’, ‘e’, ‘s’, ‘o’, ‘u’, ‘r’, ‘c’, ‘e’)
