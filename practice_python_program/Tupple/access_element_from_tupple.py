# Q2: Given the tuple (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), access and print the third element.
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(my_tuple[2])
# O/p: 3

# Q22:Write a Python program to get the 4th element from the last element of a tuple.
# Create a tuple containing a sequence of items
tuplex = ("w", 3, "r", "e", "s", "o", "u", "r", "c", "e")
# Print the contents of the 'tuplex' tuple
print(tuplex)

# Get the 4th element of the tuple (index 3)
item = tuplex[3]
# Print the value of the 'item'
print(item)

# Get the 4th element from the end of the tuple (index -4)
item1 = tuplex[-4]
# Print the value of the 'item1'
print(item1) 
# o/p: (‘w’, 3, ‘r’, ‘e’, ‘s’, ‘o’, ‘u’, ‘r’, ‘c’, ‘e’)
# e
# u
