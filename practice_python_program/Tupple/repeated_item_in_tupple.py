# Q24:Write a Python program to find repeated items in a tuple.
# Create a tuple containing a sequence of numbers
tuplex = 2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7
# Print the contents of the 'tuplex' tuple
print(tuplex)
# Count the number of times the value 4 appears in the 'tuplex' tuple
count = tuplex.count(4)
# Print the count of how many times 4 appears
print(count) 
# O/p: (2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7)
# 3
