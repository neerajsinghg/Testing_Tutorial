Common Sorting Algorithm Implementations:
While Python's built-in sorting is generally preferred for performance, understanding and implementing other algorithms is crucial for educational purposes and specific scenarios.

Bubble Sort: Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order, repeatedly passing through the list.

Selection Sort: Repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted portion and swaps it with the first unsorted element. 

Insertion Sort: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time, inserting each new element into its correct position within the already sorted part.

Merge Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides the list into halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.

Quick Sort: Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that picks an element as a pivot and partitions the array around the pivot.

Heap Sort: Uses a binary heap data structure to efficiently sort elements.
