//451. Sort Characters By Frequency
//Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.
//Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.
//Example 1:
//Input: s = "tree"
//Output: "eert"
//Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
//So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
//Example 2:
//Input: s = "cccaaa"
//Output: "aaaccc"
//Explanation: Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so both "cccaaa" and "aaaccc" are valid answers.
//Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
//Example 3:
//Input: s = "Aabb"
//Output: "bbAa"
//Explanation: "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
//Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
