# RAG using OpenAI's Assistant API : GPT-Series

This repository provides a practical guide to building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using OpenAI’s Assistant API with Large Language Models (LLMs) from GPT Series, and PDF documents as the primary data source. The guide walks developers through the steps of setting up a vector store, creating an AI assistant, and managing conversation threads to effectively implement RAG systems.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- An OpenAI API Key
- PDF documents to serve as the knowledge base

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
    ```bash
    g
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file in the same directory as `main.py`:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    ```

## Setting Up

1. Place your PDF documents in `Upload` folder in the same directory as `main.py`.
2. The environment variables will be loaded from the `.env` file, and the script will automatically interact with the OpenAI API.

## How to Use

1. **Upload PDFs to Vector Store:**
   The function `upload_PDFs_to_vector_store` allows you to upload your PDF documents to the vector store, making them searchable by the RAG system.

2. **Create a Vector Store:**
   The function `get_or_create_vector_store` either retrieves an existing vector store or creates a new one for storing vector embeddings of documents.

3. **Create an AI Assistant:**
   Use `get_or_create_assistant` to create or retrieve an AI assistant capable of querying the vector store for relevant information.

4. **Start a Conversation:**
   After setting up the assistant, you can start a conversation using the Assistant API. The conversation thread will process user inputs, retrieve relevant information from the vector store, and respond with citations if applicable.

5. **Run the Conversation:**
   The assistant runs in a real-time conversation loop, where you can ask questions, and the assistant retrieves information from the PDFs to provide meaningful responses.

## Example Usage

1. **Create and upload PDFs:**
    ```python
    vectorStore = get_or_create_vector_store(client, "your_vector_store_name_here")
    ```

2. **Create an AI Assistant:**
    ```python
    assistant = get_or_create_assistant(client, model_name, "your_assistant_name_here", vector_store.id)
    ```

3. **Start a conversation:**
    ```python
    message_thread = client.beta.threads.create(**thread_conversation)
    ```

## Best Practices

- Ensure PDFs are well-structured and relevant to the domain for improved performance.
- Use meaningful filenames and metadata for better file management.
- Tune parameters like `temperature` and `top_p` for the assistant based on your specific use case.
- Utilize query augmentation and context to improve the retrieval quality in RAG systems.
